# Mi personal website

I'm Gianfranco Elli, a Software Engineer.

I love spending time looking 'underneath the hood' to understand the magic behind the scenes.

## Inspiration

I took inspiration from [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/) and [Lydia Hallie](https://www.lydiahallie.io/)'s personal sites.
